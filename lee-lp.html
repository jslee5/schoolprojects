            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Big K.R.I.T. returns with the Digital Rose Tour, an uncannily loose yet precise rapper and accomplished producer, Big K.R.I.T. has continued in a lineage of Southern rap legends who include UGK, 8Ball and MJG, OutKast, and David Banner.</p>
            <p> He spent years honing his skills on the mixtape circuit before signing with Def Jam, a deal that led to the Top Ten albums Live from the Underground and Cadillactica.</p>
            <p> K.R.I.T. has since been independent with his Multi Alumni label, the outlet for his third consecutive Top Ten full-length, 4eva Is a Mighty Long Time, and a set of later EPs summarized as TDT.</p>
            <p>He has either produced and appeared on material from the likes of Wiz Khalifa, Curren$y, Freddie Gibbs, and Rick Ross.</p>
